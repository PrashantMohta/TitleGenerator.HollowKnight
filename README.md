# Hollow Knight Title Generator


## Get started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). 

## Building and running in production mode

To create an optimised version of the app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can run the newly built app with `npm run start`. This uses [sirv](https://github.com/lukeed/sirv), which is included in your package.json's `dependencies` so that the app will work when you deploy to platforms like [Heroku](https://heroku.com).
